This README.md is for the 4th homework assignment, which was to build an online quiz. The bullet points below are what I was able to accomplish.

* Create functioning buttons in the script
* Have a functioning timer that counts down
* When a question is answered correctly a point is added to the score
* At the end of the timer, or if the questions are all answered first you will be able to insert initials and see your name and score posted 
* Create a button that allows you to play again
* Create cards that notify you if you answered the question wrong or right

The bullet points below are the things I was not able to resolve before turning in the assignment.

* A question placeholder can be seen, but the quiz questions themselves do not populate on the page when they are supposed to
* The answer buttons show up undefined instead of listing which letter and answer it is
